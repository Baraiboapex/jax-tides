How to find the closest tide station based on the user's current location:

1.) Write a custom web service that utilizes Djikstra's algorithm to find the 
closest tide station node.

2.) Find out if the Noaa API can find the closest node for you without having to write the 
custom web service as mentioned above! ;)
