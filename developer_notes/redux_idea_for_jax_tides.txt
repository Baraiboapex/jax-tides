Steps to implement redux into Jax Tides App

1.) Will use redux to keep an application state for the current time of day. For determining which picture of the ocean to load 
into the application background, and also how to show tide prediction data based on the current time of day.

2.)If the current time of day is greater than the latest tide prediction of the current day, then the application
will reload all of its tide prediction data and display said data for the following day.
